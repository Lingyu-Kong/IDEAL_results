# IDEAL Data and Results Repository

This repository serves as a resource for accessing the code necessary for data retrieval and analysis pertaining to the IDEAL project. The complete code for the implementation of the IDEAL algorithm is made available through a private Gitfront repository for review purposes. The structure of this repository includes multiple directories, with each one featuring its own README file to assist users.

Please note that some folders may be empty until the end of February 2024, as we are in the process of data cleansing to ensure the removal of any sensitive information. Rest assured, all data and analysis code will be fully accessible by the end of February 2024.

## Environment Setup

The environment dependencies for this code repository are as follows:

- ipykernel
